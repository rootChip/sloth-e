# Sloth-E — Project Context

Role: IT & Security Director

Purpose:
Build a public-facing organization site that demonstrates
system architecture discipline, security boundaries,
and future storefront readiness.

Constraints:
- No sensitive data exposed
- Static-first
- No auth, no database, no tracking
- Secure by absence

Audience:
- Public (default)
- Internal and Board systems exist but are not exposed

This repository is structured to avoid refactors as systems activate.
